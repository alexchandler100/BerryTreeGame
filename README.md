This repository contains source code for the video game Berry Tree: Hausdorffs in the Darkworld, created by myself and based on my experience as a undergraduate student at Michigan State University.

# To play:

clone the repository and run a local host from within the directory:
Open a terminal in the directory and using python2 run the code

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8910

or with python3 you may use

python -m http.server 8910

Then go to a web browser and type in:

localhost:8910

If localhost:8910 gets messed up somehow just change 8910 to 8911 or anything really (just run both lines of code with the new server number).
